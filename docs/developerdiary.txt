Scratching Out a Game Plan
==========================

RSS has been sneaking back into my mind. I loved Google Reader and fell backon 
Feedly but now it's been in my head to make my own cli feed reader. This will
most likely be done with an interactive prompt using Python's ``cmd`` class
than with ``click`` unless I figure out how to integrate the two.

It is a much bigger project that I initially thought. There's a lot of data to
keep track of and no established method of storing the data as far as I can 
tell. There is the OPML standard, but that's pretty generic and only keeps
track of what subscriptions exist, not what has been read.

Thinking ahead on this, I have to list the things I'd like to be able to do::

    >newsboy subscribe rpython https://reddit.com/r/Python/.rss
    ... subscribe to the rss feed for r/Python (assuming that's the right rss
        address

    >newsboy latest rpython
    <idx> <date> Title... <new|read>
    ... lists 10 (or 15, 20...) entry titles

    >newsboy preview 1
    ... print a text preview (first 600 characters or so of the first indexed
        article

    >newsboy open 2
    ... open's the second item in the list in a web browser

    >newsboy mark 3
    ... mark the third item in the list as read
    
    >newsboy all rpython --unread
    ... list all known rpython articles that haven't been marked as read

    >newsboy save 1
    ... saves the first item into permanent storage

A few things about these sketches tells me I need to keep track of a lot of
data. 

    * There is an idea of a LIST, which can be reset at any time
    * Each feed needs to track what has been downloaded and what is new or read
      (and I want to add, possibly, a seen option in there)
    * I can store the latest xml files from each subscription, and then I need
      to store meta data:  when did I last download, what articles have been 
      seen or read, etc.
    * I'm going to need to figure out how to indicate there's an image in the
      article.

I also don't know enough details to ensure I can treet several different feeds
correctly. Fortunately, there is a tool called FeedReader that should make that
part of my life easier.
